# Git Exercise

1. Each person in the pair, `git clone` this repo
2. Decide, who is Person A and who is Person B
3. Tasks will be appearing below. After you complete one, another one appears. There is 10 in total.
4. First 6 tasks are always only for one person (it alternates between A and B)
5. In the remaining tasks, you will work in parallel and might even need to resolve some conflicts.

## Tasks
1. Person A - `pod.cpp` - Name your pod
    * Open `pod.cpp` file and locate TASK 1
    * Type the name for your pod inside the double-quotes (you should discuss the choice of the name with your teammate)
